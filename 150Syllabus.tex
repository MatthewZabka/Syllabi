\noindent \textbf{Course Description}:  A detailed study of the mathematics needed for calculus. Concepts are presented and explored from symbolic, graphical, and numerical perspectives. Basic concepts covered include polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions, complex numbers, linear systems, numerical patterns, sequences and series.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Grading}: Grades are determined as follows:\\
\begin{center} \begin{minipage}{5in}
\begin{flushleft}
Three in-class exams \dotfill 45\%\\
Final exam \dotfill 35\%\\
In-class worksheets \dotfill 10\%\\
Homework \dotfill 10\%\\

\vskip.25in

A \dotfill 93\% - 100 \%\\
A- \dotfill 90\% - 92.9\%\\
B+ \dotfill 87\% - 89.9\%\\
B  \dotfill 83\% - 86.9\%\\
and so on
\end{flushleft}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Homework and Worksheets}: The best way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics. Homework will therefore be assigned regularly. No late homework will be accepted. In-class worksheets must be done in class. Your two lowest homework scores, as well as your two lowest worksheet scores, will be dropped.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Exams}: There will be three in-class exams. Only in the case of an extreme emergency, religious conflict or sanctioned university event will a makeup exam be considered. In the case of an emergency, you must contact me as soon as possible to make me aware of the emergency. If your final exam percentage is higher than your worst exam's percentage, then your final exam percentage will replace your worst exam's percentage. In the case of a religious conflict or sanctioned university event, or should you require a nontraditional testing environment, you must notify me at least one week before the exam.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Final Exam}: The final exam will be held on Thursday, December 15, 2016, 8:00am - 9:50am.  It is cumulative. Any student who fails to earn 60 \% or better on the final exam will receive a grade no higher than a D+.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Academic Honesty}:  All students are expected to adhere to the SMSU Code of Conduct. Any type of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. In the event of academic dishonesty, the student will receive an F in the course.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Extra Help}:  Do not hesitate to come to my office during office hours or by appointment. The SMSU Math Help Center, which offers free tutoring, is also available to you. The Math Help Center is located in the Academic Commons, IL224.


\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Attendance Policy}: Students are expected to attend classes regularly.  Attendance will occasionally be taken. Should you miss class, it is your responsibility to obtain a copy of the notes from a classmate. You are responsible for the material that was covered and any announcements that were made.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Calculators}: Calculators may not be used on exams or on worksheets.
